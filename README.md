# MPC with feedforward Steady-State Target Optimization (SSTO)

The following document presents a constrained Linear Quadratic Model Predictive Model Control (LQ-MPC) with offset-free tracking and disturbance rejection using the Feedforward Steady-State Target Optimization (SSTO) approach for an isolated power systems. 

The MPC control law uses Finite-Receding-Horizon method in dual-mode. The stability and recursive feasibility are guaranteed by off-line dual-mode and on-line optimization and the results are presented by Matlab simulation.
